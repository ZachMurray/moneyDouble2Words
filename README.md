# moneyDouble2Words


I have one "take home" technical competency assessment: 

Please create a class in Java with a public static method which takes a double money amount as argument and returns a string of that amount in words. \
For example, if the amount is 723.80 then the expected result would be â€œseven hundred twenty three dollars and eighty cents". \
Code should be formatted according to the Google Java style guide and delivered as a maven project with junit5 compatible unit tests. 

Please provide your code when completed.
